# Requirements for Distributed Taxi Dispatch System
# Core requirements (mandatory)
# No additional packages required - uses Python standard library

# Optional requirements for enhanced functionality
ortools>=9.0.0         # For advanced constraint programming optimization
spade>=3.2.0           # For distributed multi-agent communication
aioxmpp>=0.11.0        # XMPP support for SPADE

# Development and testing (optional)
pytest>=6.0.0          # For testing
pytest-asyncio>=0.18.0 # For async testing

# Notes:
# - System works without any additional packages (fallback modes)
# - OR-Tools provides optimal assignment via constraint programming
# - SPADE enables distributed communication between taxi system nodes
# - tkinter is included with Python standard library for GUI
